# Python-shopping

A simple code made to be used by shops of any kind. This python code can be used by two admin(owners) and users(consumers).
Both of them have their own modules and have many choices to go through.


### This code can be used to undestand the use of datetime library
        *from datetime import datetime
         now = datetime.now()
         dt_tm = now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
         print("Date of purchase: ", dt_tm[0:10])
         print("Time of purchase: ", dt_tm[11:19])


### This code also shows how to print data in table form in Python 3 neatly without any api
        *print('%-18s%-16i%-11i%i'%(i,stock[i],basket[i],total))
